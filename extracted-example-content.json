knew the pattern, how it was meant to flow<br>\r\n                Turned the neighborhood into her own little show<br>\r\n                No cap, no doubt, just pure instinct and grit<br>\r\n

Her voice wasn't just noise, it was the world to save<br>\r\n                From mediocrity, from the everyday hue<br>\r\n                She'd spit her truth, make 'em stop, make 'em rewind,

Defying gravity, takin' every single swear<br>\r\n                At the mic, yeah, but the real battle was within<br>\r\n                Against the naysayers, against the fading sun<br>\r\n                Each verse a brick, each line a step forward, slow<br>\r\n                But steady progress, watch the meter go<br>\r\n                From obscurity's shadows, peekin' through the

              From \"Why is this chick spittin'?\" to \"Word to your main\"<br>\r\n                The persistence paid off, the effort finally showed<br>\r\n                She wasn't just rippin', she was livin' out the code<br>\r\n                The dream, that childhood promise, finally startin' to bloom<br>\r\n                From the concrete jungle, from the hardest of rooms<br>\r\n                The square and the bar, the stage was finally hers<br>\r\n                The girl who just wanted to rap is now on top of the charts and stirs</p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>Verse 4</h2>\r\n

   Believe it through, even when the future looked grim<br>\r\n                Like watchin' time fly by, watchin' the big dreams dim<br>\r\n                But she held on tight, kept the faith, kept the flow<br>\r\n                Turned doubt into doubtlessness, yeah, that's how she got here, you know<br>\r\n                Pushed through the pain, through the nights and the days<br>\r\n                Every single syllable, every single breath, paid<br>\r\n                The price to be here, to be recognized, to stand<br>\r\n                And say these words, and make the whole world understand<br>\r\n                This ain't just luck, this ain't just hype, this is the proof<br>\r\n                Of a dream that wouldn't die, kept on its life-support<br>\r\n                By grit and grace, by sweat and tears, by soul<br>\r\n                This whole damn thing is real, ain't no cap, no fake, no hole<br>\r\n                In the end, it doesn't even matter why it started, does it?<br>\r\n                Just know the fight, the sacrifice, the whole damn process it took<br>\r\n                From the playground to this stage, from silent prayer to the
